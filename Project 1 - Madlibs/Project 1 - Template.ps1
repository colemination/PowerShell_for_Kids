    Write-Output "One day, YOUNG Johnny decided to take his DOG spot for a walk.  While WALKING through the woods `
        he came across a WIDE creek.  Spot was eager to JUMP in, but Johnny was hesitant, as he didn't want `
        to get his shoes WET.  He tried WALKING around the creek, but it was too LONG.  Finally, he decided `
        to take off his SHOES, roll up his pants and cross the creek.  Unfortunately, as he did he slipped `
        and fell in the CREEK, completely soaking his PANTS.  The now wet Johnny walked back home again in `
        the grumpiest of moods, and never walked that way in the WOODS again."
